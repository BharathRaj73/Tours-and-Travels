          Hello Team! Thanks for coordinating my memorable Maldives trip and
          choosing the best resort to stay which had world class facilities.
          Even the ticketing and all the other necessary documentation was taken
          care . Will be getting back to you for booking my next international
          trip. Thanks üôè

          Thank you for arranging the European Delights package for me and
          family.Most of the hotels we stayed at were very good 4 star rated
          such as Courtyard Marriott at Basel, Holiday Inn at Paris etc.. Indian
          food twice a day was a major plus apart from a very friendly and
          cooperative tour manager and Coach captain.
